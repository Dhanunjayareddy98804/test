2)the 10 keywords in java are:
int: it is used for numbers 
long : it is used for length
char : it is used for characters
void : it is used as variable
return  : it is used for returning the value once execution is completed
public : it is used access specifier it is avialble to all the users.
static : it is used 
else : it is used condition to check false.
boolean : it used for to check whether it is true or false.
class : it is real world objects


4)variable : : It is a container used to store data which can be used in the later stages of the program.

types of variable are:
static : it is declaring method ouside the body
local : it is declaring meyhod inside the body 
instance  : without static declaring class outside of method
parameter : it is delcaring inside the methods

5)difference btw primitive and non primtive

primitive :
1)In this it as size depend on the data type
2)start with lowercase letter
3)already existed in java
4)it always have a some value
5)examples of primtive are int ,char ,float ,double

non primitive:
1)start with uppercase
2)here the size is not there
3)it is consists of null value
4)examples of non primitive are .class ,string ,reference

6)identifier : name given to the variables.
Any name which is used in source code is called identifier.
Example: class name, argument name etc.

keywords:
keywords are pre-defined words which has some meaning.
 		Example:   int, float, char etc.
		Total keywords are: 50 + 3.

literals:
values assigned to any variables is referred as literals.

arrays:Array is container which is used to store more than one value which is of similar data type.

methods: :   Block of statement which is used to perform certain functionalities.

7)method overloading :  two or more methods with same method name but differ in their parameter list is known as method overloading. 
Parameter list:    a. Number of parameters.
		        b. type of parameters.

8).How do you write an infinite loop using the for statement?
for(int index = 0; ;index++){
	
}

10) Explain the main method?
//public static void main(String args[])]

<access modifiers> return type <method name> (parameter1, parameter2, parameter3, …………………., parametern) {
	//body of method or block of method
}
